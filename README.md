# Team-Profile-Generator


Project and development of a node.js application that will allow users to quickly create a README file through the prompt.


## About Me 
Born and raised in Italy, I moved to the UK in 2015. I have always been interested in new technologies and IT, as I studied IT in my A levels back in Italy. After 5 years working in content management for a website, I decided to make the step of learning Front-End Development thanks to the edX course, and on my gitHub profile I showcase not only my progress in Front-End Development as a student but also a journey that hopefully will lead to new exciting projects in this field.

## Usage

To use this app, simply follow the instructions in the Installation paragraph below, then lounch the prompt, go in the project directory where the index.js file is, and write the command:

```bash
node index.js
```
Once the program has been lounched just follow the instructions and input the data you want to include in your README file. Here is a video of the step-by-step procedure to generate your README file:

## App Description 

The README file generator app will run in the prompt of commands allowing users to quickly generate and complete their README file simply launching the index.js file and following the shown instruction, writing the project title, description, usage, process etc information that will be then ordered and written into the generated README file.

## Credits

I would like to thank all the teachers and TA of the EdX bootcamp for all the content provided and study materials. I found the information needed to implement the checkbox in the [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) website.

## Project Status and Upcoming Improvements

The app is functional and easy to launch and use, the user can easily create the README file and add all the descriptions and data needed. The next step will be to include pics and gif through a link and also create a web application with a nice html/css structure that will allow users to select the directory where they want to create their README file and follow the same procedure of the prompt commands to generate it.
